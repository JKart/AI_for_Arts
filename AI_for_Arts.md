As part of Google’s ongoing commitment to support ambitious computer science research and the arts, Google Arts & Culture, in collaboration with Google AI, invite proposals from contemporary artists working with machine learning in their art practices. 

Artists + Machine Intelligence (AMI) grants will support six artists with technical mentorship, core Google research, and funding. Artists will have the opportunity to work with Google creative technologists to develop and produce artworks over the course of a five-month period. Mentorship may cover technical processes like data collection and analysis, to pipeline design, and model deployment, and includes access to core Google U/X and technical research in generative and decentralized machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. 

The final work and the ‘Making Of’ process (e.g. open-source code, the public data set(s), learnings) will be featured in a dedicated section on the Google Arts & Culture platform. 

Apart from any Google background IP (if relevant), artists will own IP of their artwork.
